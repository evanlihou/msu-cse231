# msu-cse231
Project solutions from Michigan State's CSE 231 in the Spring Semester of 2018
Included are project files, project specification documents, and relevant data files used by the program.

## A NOTE ABOUT USE
These solutions have already been submitted to the online grading platform Mimir. Attempting to submit the code in this repository as your is academically dishonest and can get you expelled from your academic institution.
Seriously, don't do it.

I retain all rights to the code in this repository, and its sole purpose is to provide as a guide for solutions to similar projects and to show my knowledge of Python.
